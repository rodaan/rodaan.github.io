I am a full-stack software engineer with a strong background in JavaScript. I like to explore the sources of problems and determining the appropriate solution for a given problem by running through potential side effects and limitations before writing a line of code. I thrive in environments where communication is open and autonomy is expected. I enjoy the whole scope of engineering from choosing what technologies are best for a given task and optimizing an algorithm to developing new features for a product.

I have extensive experiences in data analytics, statistical analysis, social media technologies, market research, databases, and application development. I am also interested in machine learning, natural language processing, and cybersecurity.

I'm currently looking for new opportunities!
