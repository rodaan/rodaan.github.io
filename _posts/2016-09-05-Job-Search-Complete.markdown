Hi everyone!   

So I've completed my job search! I will be working as a contractor through ERG for Cisco! Should be exciting! I'm hope to enjoy learning how software engineering teams work in large corporate companies like Cisco Systems.
  
I'll be working as a Node.js Software Engineer. I took the job primarily because I find the backend of applications more interesting and mentally stimulating and it was the only back end focused opportunity available to me. But we shall see! I'm hoping to learn other languages on the back end such as Rust and Go and become more competant technically.      
I recently took a trip up to Vancouver to visit family and now am preparing to start work on September 7th. In the mean time, I've been brushing up on Python and also learning Bitwise Operations.  
  
After intensely learning Javascript for a while, I've found that there are some interesting differences between the Javascript and Python. So the next post I'll do will be about the differences between the two. Keep and eye open for that! I'll also be doing a post about Bitwise operations to help people who find it intimidating. It's actually pretty simple once you get your mind wrapped around base 2 counting! Python actually makes learning it a lot easier with the way it handles binary formats!  
  
So the post title says "Guitar" right? Well I've decided to take up classical guitar. Seeing as I'll be very busy with work and other technical problems, I've decided to take lessons at [www.classicalguitardelcamp.com](http://www.classicalguitardelcamp.com/). The lessons are free and are aimed at amateurs like me! They also correspond to the first six years at music school. Here is a poster:
