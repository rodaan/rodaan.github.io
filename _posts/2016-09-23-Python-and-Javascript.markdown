Work has been pretty good so far. The first week was pretty much a brain dump. Funny enough, I haven't touched a lick of Javascript. Most of my work has been on the backend and thus, I've been getting acquainted with Linux. So for now, good bye to pretty GUIs. It's all command line for now. I've been taking the Cisco shuttle from SF to San Jose so I have more time on my hands.  

Prior to me starting my job, I ended up picking up Python again. Python had actually been my first programming language. I had learned in initially in middle school/high school during an IT class I had taken. I found the class very interesting and loved programming but despite my efforts (it was the only class that I ended up using in personal projects outside of school. I made a game among other things...), the teacher didn't really seem very interested in teaching and had given me a B+, which was terrible for my previously pristine academic record and scared me away from what would have been an early start to my Engineering career. Now that I am many years older, I realize now that grades don't mean anything. In fact, I think the whole education system is crap (something which I may write about in the future...) I digress.  

Anyways, the point of this post is to outline the basic differences between Python and Javascript. Something that I've learned is that once you have "mastered" a language (I say this in quotes because you don't truly master a language), it becomes very easy to learn new languages as it is all a matter of syntax and design. These two differences make certain languages effective and some things and terrible in others.

So to start off, I'll start with the heart of all things javascript, Functions:

{% highlight javascript %}
function squared(num){
    return num * num;
}
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight python %}
def squared(num):
    return num * num
{% endhighlight %}

Right off the bat, we see a few differences. Functions are defined with the "def" keyword.
